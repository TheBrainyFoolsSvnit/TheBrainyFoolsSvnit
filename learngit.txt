By this commit I would like to share how to install and to use some basic git commands


Git is an distributed version control software.

One can download git software from, https://git-scm.com/downloads  (copy this link in the search bar of your browser)

Some of the basic commands for git are available at, https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

So, these are the sources that helped me in learning git.
